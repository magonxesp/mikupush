## Server

### Build

Requirements:
* Go 1.24

Go to the `server` directory and build the binary executable.

```sh
go build
```

Alternatively, you can build the docker image too.

```sh
docker build . -t mikupush/server:latest
```

### Deploy

Go to the `server` directory.

#### Running the binary executable

Requirements:
* PostgreSQL 17.2

> ℹ️ Remember to create a database on the PostgreSQL server and execute the `schema.sql` script.

Create the `.env` file from the `.env.example` and configure the PostgreSQL server connection.

Once you have the server binary executable and a PostgreSQL server and the `.env` file you can run it on the command line directly.

##### Linux or macOS

```sh
chmod +x server
./server
```

You can create a `systemd` service on Linux running the server binary executable.

###### Windows

```powershell
.\server.exe
```

#### With docker compose 🐳

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and put the following content or use the existing.

```yml
services:
  server:
    image: magonx/mikupush-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/server/data
    env_file:
      - ./.env
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17.2
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: miku_push
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: miku_push
      POSTGRES_DB: miku_push

volumes:
  postgres:
```

Create the `.env` file from the `.env.example` and configure the PostgreSQL server connection.

And then run the containers with docker compose.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

> ℹ️ You can use the same content of the `docker-compose.yml` for create a stack in docker swarm.

## App

### Build

Requirements:
* Node 22.14 LTS

Go to the `app` directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Build source code in production mode.

```sh
npm run build:prod
```

Or for debugging you can build the dev version.

```sh
npm run build:dev
```

Then you can build the application binaries.

```sh
npm run make
```

You can find the binaries and installers on the `target` directory.
